# HR-Employee-Absenteeism-Analysis-
The goal of this project was to analyze absenteeism data and identify patterns that impact business performance. By using SQL for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for visualization, I was able to develop an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights for HR teams.

Employee absenteeism is a critical issue that affects productivity and operational efficiency in organizations. As businesses strive to optimize workforce management, data-driven insights play a crucial role in understanding absenteeism patterns and addressing the underlying causes. In this blog, Iâ€™ll walk you through my project on HR Absenteeism Analysis, where I leveraged SQL and Power BI to uncover key insights and trends.

### Dataset Used
The dataset contains records of employee absenteeism, including details such as:

- Employee ID
- Date of absence
- Reason for absence
- Department
- Working hours lost
- Age, BMI, and other demographics
- Transportation issues, alcohol consumption, and other external factors

### Data Preparation and Cleaning with SQL
Before diving into visualization, I first cleaned and structured the data using SQL. The key steps involved were:

- Handling Missing Values: Replacing or removing null values in key columns.
- Standardizing Formats: Ensuring consistency in date formats and categorical variables.
- Creating Calculated Fields: Generating new columns such as total hours lost per employee and absenteeism rates per department.
- Filtering Outliers: Identifying and excluding extreme cases to maintain data integrity.
